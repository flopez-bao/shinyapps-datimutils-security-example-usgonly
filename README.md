The following example app was built to demonstrate the use of functionality in datimutils for securing data access specifically for data meant to be accessible to only USG Folks. In order to run this application do the following:
  
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open as a project.
3. If you don’t already have `renv` installed make sure to install it and then run `renv::activate()` — you may be prompted to follow up with `renv::restore()`.
4. You will also be asked to install all the packages listed in the `renv.lock` file.
5. Edit your `.Rprofile` in your root directory where you can point to datim.
6. Reload the project so that the environment variables are available to the app. You can now run the app.
